Miscellanous scripts for miscellaneous tasks, some for work, some for fun
====================

* cisco-asa-threat-drop-rate-stats.pl
    Scan for Cisco ASA logs and show a recommended value for both "max configured current rate" and "max configured average rate"
* fatpack.sh
    The basic recipe for packing described in the [fatpack](http://search.cpan.org/~mstrout/App-FatPacker-0.009001/bin/fatpack "App::FatPacker") documentation does not seem to work, so I created this one.
* jefit2csv.rb
    Export the data of the [JEFIT](http://www.jefit.com/ "JEFIT") Android App to a CSV while calculating total volume and reps for each exercise.
* hexdump.pl
    Display the specified file in decimal or hexadecimal format
